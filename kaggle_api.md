# Official Kaggle API

For setup and basic usage the README at <https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api> is quite clear and straight forward.

Moreover, the relevant command line to download the data is given under the "Data" tab on each Kaggle competition's page; e.g.,

```
kaggle competitions download -c airbus-ship-detection
```
