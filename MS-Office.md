# Blog article: GTD and InBox Zero with Microsoft Outlook - Simon Angling

<https://simonangling.com/gtd-and-inbox-zero-with-outlook/>

## Summary

GTD: collect, process, organize, review, and do.

- General setup: adjust work week start and end times in the calendar settings; define Quick Steps as described in the blog post; create custom To-Do lists as in the blog post; create custom Categories

### 1. Collect
- your inbox
- create non-email based tasks if needed
- email yourself if needed. Can create rules to tag emails easily based on the text in subject line or email address.

### 2. Process
- do it now, delegate it, defer it (flag and QuickSteps), delete it (delete), or file it (archive or QuickSteps).
- For delegating, can use "forward" Quick steps, in combination with flags and/or categories (e.g., A: somebody). Can also use Autoagenda Quick step for very repetitive forwards (e.g., you want to attach the same message to the forwarded email each time). I'm not using any of this, as I currently don't have much to delegate.

### 3. Organize
- Priorities, categories, search (can use categories and priorities to narrow it down), search folders.

### 4-5. Review and Do
- Use the custom to-do list views set up as in the blog post.


### Searching
- F3 for basic search
- Then can click on categories and priorities in the ribbon to filter

#### Search folders
- For example to create a search folder showing all messages of given category: Right click "Search Folders" on the left > "New Search Folder" > "Categorized mail" > "Choose".
- To further modify criteria, right click the created search folder, then "Customize".

# Outlook 2-minute delay for sending email

<https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-need-2-minute-delay-your-email-heres-how-justin-hampton-ccp/>

1. Navigate to the File section of Outlook.
2. Select "Manage Rules and Alerts"
3. Select "Apply rule on messages I send" and hit "Next"
4. Hit Next, again. You don't need to do anything on this screen. Say "OK" when Outlook tells you that this will apply to every message you send. That's the idea...
5. Click the check box: Select "defer deliver a number of minutes" at the very bottom.
6. Click the word "minutes" and select the number of minutes you want to delay the delivery. Personally, I like 2 minutes. Hit "Next"
7. If you would like to add any exceptions to the rule, you may do that here. I like to create an exception so that messages marked with High Importance are not delayed. Hit "Next"
8. Review your rule and make sure that the check box next to "Turn on this rule" is checked, and hit "Finish"
