# QMK

## Specific keyboards

If there is anything noteworthy, I keep notes in the keyboard-specific directories of my fork of `qmk_firmware`.

## Errors

When experiencing errors a few things to try:

1. `qmk clean --all`.
2. Re-install and set up everything as in: <https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/tutorial/newbs_getting_started>.
3. Search QMK Discord server.
